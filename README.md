# Project Exam 2

Take the skills learned over the last two years and take on an extensive project where the finished product should reflect the candidateâ€™s general development capabilities, in addition to visual and technical skills.

## Vacay

Find the perfect venue for you. Maybe you're looking for a small cozy cabin? Or a big mansion for you and all your friends? Well we've got the place for you!

This project will be built with the following tech stack:

```
react + react-router-dom + zustand + shadcn/ui + tailwindcss + typescript
```

I will also set up CI / CD with:

```
cypress + github pages + husky
```
