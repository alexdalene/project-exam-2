Take the skills learned over the last two years and take on an extensive project where the finished product should reflect the candidateâ€™s general development capabilities, in addition to visual and technical skills.

## Holidaze

Find the perfect venue for you. Whether you're looking for a small cozy cabin or a grand mansion for you and all your friends, we've got the place for you!

## Tech Stack

This project is built with:

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **React Router DOM**: To handle routing.
- **Zustand**: For state management.
- **shadcn/ui**: UI framework built with TypeScript and TailwindCSS.
- **TailwindCSS**: For styling.
- **TypeScript**: For strong typing.
- **Three.js & React Three Fiber**: For 3D effects.

### Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates workflows.
- **Husky**: For Git hooks.

### Testing

- **Cypress**: For end-to-end testing.

## Key Decisions

### Styling Framework

Opted for **shadcn/ui** as it's built with TypeScript and TailwindCSS, seamlessly integrating with the rest of the tech stack.

### Venue Manager

The user interface does not expose venue management directly. Users automatically gain venue management capabilities when they create a venue, simplifying the user experience.

### Pagination

Pagination is hidden when searching or sorting because of the API specifics.

### Hosting

Switched from Netlify to Vercel due to compatibility issues with Bun as the node runtime.
